## What I'm Learning

- Java syntax and structure
- Clean method creation and usage
- String operations and manipulation
- Arrays, loops, and conditionals

## Sample Code

```java
// Reverse a string using loop
public String reverse(String input) {
    String reversed = "";
    for (int i = input.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        reversed += input.charAt(i);
    }
    return reversed;
}
